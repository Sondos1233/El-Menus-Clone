          that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of, or access to, the
          Site, Service, Content or otherwise from your User Submissions,
          violation of these Terms of Use, or infringement by you, or any third

        <h3>Integration and Severability.</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and Elmenus
          with respect to the Service and use of the Site, Service, Content,
          User Submissions or Add-to Link, and supersede all prior or
          contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or
          electronic) between you and Elmenus with respect to the Site. If any
          provision of these Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or
          invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum
          extent necessary so that these Terms of Use will otherwise remain in
          full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to
          exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be
          deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Waiver of compliance
          in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance
          in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms
          of Use to be binding, Elmenus must provide you with written notice of
          such waiver through one of its authorized representatives.
